		note: I use let in the for blocks mainly to indicate that it is a variable that will be reassigned. 
		I think it makes reading the code easier. As far as function goes. Using let in a block confines its scope to that block
		which doesn't have an effect here because I'm never using a variable outside the blocks anyway, but it could make a difference in
		other situations.
