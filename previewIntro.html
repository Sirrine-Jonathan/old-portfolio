	Each link to the left represents a study topic<br />
	that is examined in one sandbox or broken down into<br />
	smaller categories that are then each examined.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
	The code for each of these can be seen by visiting this<br />
	sites repository using the link at the bottom of this page<br />
	or by viewing the source files in the developer tools of your browser.
	</p>
	<p>
	The aim of this site is to provide a basic example of each study topic<br />
	and thereby offer a simplified look at the functionality of JavaScript in the<br />
	webpage.
